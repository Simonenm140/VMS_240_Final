            <p2> <span style="color: #A0D11C"> CompostMates </span> has a unique origin story in that it began as a result of two separate teams working on the same idea. In July 2020, Caroline Shubel enlisted her friend, Olivia Tseng, to work on an idea for a food scrap pick up service for off-campus students. <br> <br> Just a couple months later, Lydia Rowen, along with Ideliya Khismatova, Daniel Sheyko, and Jason Yang, came together within the Environmental Affairs Committee (EAC) of UNC student government to work on the same project idea. The two teams worked separately to prepare for a launch in the Spring. <br> <br> It was not until December 2020 that Caroline and Olivia learned of the EAC team when they launched their Instagram page. After an introductory Zoom call, the two teams decided to combine, and the rest is history!</p2>
